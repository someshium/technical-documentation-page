            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
            It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected
             to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>

             <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and
                  a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. 
                  Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with
                   additional objects; for example:</p>

        </section>
